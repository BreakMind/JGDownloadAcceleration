------------------

JGDownloadAcceleration is a Networking library for iOS targeted at downloading large files on to the device's hard disk.

JGDownloadAcceleration's main part is a concurrent NSOperation subclass (JGDownloadOperation) which handles the multipart download.

For managing and queing multiple operations, JGDownloadAcceleration provides a NSOoperationQueue subclass (JGOperationQueue) which handles the networking thread, activity indicator and application background task.


Q. How does the download acceleration even work?

A. Download accelerators (multipart download) use multiple network connections to download a file from a server in chunks (each connection downloads one part of the entire content). This allows to bypass bandwidth limitations set by the server and download speeds can be drastically increased.

More info: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Download_manager#Download_acceleration">Wikipedia</a>


The server from which downloading a content needs to support the `Range` header in order to use multipart download. See <a href="#requirements">Requirements</a> for more Info.

##Getting started

1. Download JGDownloadAcceleration
2. Add the whole "JGDownloadAcceleration Classes" folder to your Project
3. Start using JGDownloadAcceleration!

##Overview

JGDownloadAcceleration consists of 2 different classes that are available to use for networking.

###JGDownloadOperation
A NSOperation subclass which does the download acceleration magic.

`JGDownloadOperation` is restricted to GET HTTP Requests and to writing downloaded content directly to the hard disk.

Parameters to pass:
A `JGDownloadOperation` instance required to have the `url` parameter, and the `destinationPath` parameter set. If not the Application will terminate with an Assertion Failure.

All `JGDownloadOperation` instances should be initialized with the `initWithURL:destinationPath:resume:` method, where the URL, the local destination path and a `BOOL` to indicate whether the operation should resume (if possible) where it left of is passed.

Optionally, the number of connections to use to download the resource and a tag can be set.


`JGDownloadOperation` uses blocks to communicate with a delegate.

  - (void)setCompletionBlockWithSuccess:(void (^)(JGDownloadOperation *operation))success failure:(void (^)(JGDownloadOperation *operation, NSError *error))failure;
  - (void)setDownloadProgressBlock:(void (^)(NSUInteger bytesRead, unsigned long long totalBytesReadThisSession, unsigned long long totalBytesWritten, unsigned long long totalBytesExpectedToRead, NSUInteger tag))block;
  - (void)setOperationStartedBlock:(void (^)(NSUInteger tag, unsigned long long totalBytesExpectedToRead))block;



###JGOperationQueue
A NSOperationQueue subclass which is targeted at enqueing only `JGDownloadOperation` objects.

`JGOperationQueue` handles the shared background thread used by all `JGDownloadOperation` instances. Once all operations are finished the queue exits the networking thread.

Optionally, `JGOperationQueue` handles the status bar NetworkActivityIndicator, according to the number of enqued operations and the background task used for networking requests when the app runs in the background.

  BOOL handleNetworkActivityIndicator
  BOOL handleBackgroundTask
  
Note that when setting `handleBackgroundTask` to `YES`, the App's Info.plist file needs to have "Application uses Wi-Fi" set to `YES`.
