------------------

JGDownloadAcceleration is a Networking library for iOS targeted at downloading large files on to the device's hard disk.

JGDownloadAcceleration's main part is a concurrent NSOperation subclass (JGDownloadOperation) which handles the multipart download.

For managing and queuing multiple operations, JGDownloadAcceleration provides a NSOperationQueue subclass (JGOperationQueue) which handles the networking thread, activity indicator and application background task.


Q. How does the download acceleration even work?

A. Download accelerators (multipart download) use multiple network connections to download a file from a server in chunks (each connection downloads one part of the entire content). This allows to bypass bandwidth limitations set by the server and download speeds can be drastically increased.

More info: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Download_manager#Download_acceleration">Wikipedia</a>


The server from which downloading a content needs to support the `Range` header in order to use multipart download. See <a href="#requirements">Requirements</a> for more Info.

##Getting started

1. Download JGDownloadAcceleration
2. Add the whole "JGDownloadAcceleration Classes" folder to your Project
3. Have a read through the Overview section
4. `#import "JGDownloadAcceleration.h"`
5. Start using JGDownloadAcceleration!

##Overview

JGDownloadAcceleration consists of 2 different classes that are available to use for networking.

###JGDownloadOperation
A NSOperation subclass which does the download acceleration magic.

`JGDownloadOperation` is restricted to HTTP GET Requests and to writing downloaded content directly to the hard disk.

Parameters to pass:
A `JGDownloadOperation` instance required to have the `url` parameter, and the `destinationPath` parameter set. If not the Application will terminate with an Assertion Failure.

All `JGDownloadOperation` instances should be initialized with the `initWithURL:destinationPath:resume:` method, where the URL, the local destination path and a `BOOL` to indicate whether the operation should resume (if possible) where it left of is passed. Any files located at the destination path will be removed when starting the download.

Optionally, the number of connections to use to download the resource and a tag can be set.


`JGDownloadOperation` uses blocks to communicate with a delegate.

    - (void)setCompletionBlockWithSuccess:(void (^)(JGDownloadOperation *operation))success failure:(void (^)(JGDownloadOperation *operation, NSError *error))failure;
    - (void)setOperationStartedBlock:(void (^)(NSUInteger tag, unsigned long long totalBytesExpectedToRead))block;
    
    - (void)setDownloadProgressBlock:(void (^)(NSUInteger bytesRead, unsigned long long totalBytesReadThisSession, unsigned long long totalBytesRead, unsigned long long totalBytesExpectedToRead, NSUInteger tag))block;
    

<h4>`setOperationStartedBlock:`</h4> Used to be notified when the operation starts.
The block passes the tag (default 0) of the operation and the expected content size of the resource. The blocks is called from the network thread.

<h4>`setCompletionBlockWithSuccess:failure:`</h4> Used to be notified when the operation finishes and to be informed about the completion state (failed with an error or not?).
The completion block passes a reference to the operation, the failure block passes a reference to the operation and the error. Both blocks are called from a background thread (not the network thread).

<h4>`setDownloadProgressBlock:`</h4> Used to determine, calculate, and observe various details of the current download. This block is called on the (secondary) networking thread! It is called every time a connection inside the operation receives a chunk of data (which is automatically written to the disk). The current progress, current download speed, average download speed (and using that an estimation for the remaining time) can be calculated. For average and current speed a variable in needed to store the time intervals from the last call of the block (for the current speed) and from when the operation started. See the Example project for an implementation of this<p>
`NSUInteger bytesRead` indicates the size of the bytes read (NOT since the last call of the block, its pretty complicated because this block is called for each connection, passing the number of bytes the specific connection loaded since this specific connection last loaded a chunk of bytes).<p>
`unsigned long long totalBytesReadThisSession` the total number of bytes read in this current session. If a download is paused at 50% and then resumed, this parameter will start from 0.<p>
`unsigned long long totalBytesWritten` the total bytes read in total.<p>
`unsigned long long totalBytesExpectedToRead` the expected content size of the resource.<p>
`NSUInteger tag` the tag of the operation, very handy for managing multiple operations in a queue.
<br>
<br>
Internally this class uses a bunch of helper classes. These should not be touched by anything but the `JGDownloadOperation`.
<br>
<br>
<br>
`JGDownloadOperation` uses a metadata file to store the progress of each connection, to allow the operation to resume when failed or cancelled. The metadata file is stored at the destination path with the file extension `jgd`. The metadata file will automatically be removed when the operation finishes with success. Passing `YES` for "resume" in `initWithURL:destinationPath:resume:` will result in a attempt to read the metadata file and resume from the last known state. If reading the metadata file is not possible (if the file does not exist) the download will start from the beginning, overwriting any existing progress.
<br>

#####Cancellation:
`cancel` will stop the download,  synchronize the metadata file to allow resuming the download later and leave the partially downloaded file on the disk. The failure completion block will be called with an `NSURLErrorCancelled` error.<p>
`cancelAndClearFiles` will stop the download and remove the partially downloaded file as well as the metadata file from the disk. Neither the success completion block or the failure completion block will be called.



###JGOperationQueue
A NSOperationQueue subclass which is targeted at enqueuing only `JGDownloadOperation` objects.

`JGOperationQueue` handles the shared network thread used by all `JGDownloadOperation` instances. Once all operations are finished the queue exits the networking thread.
queue
Optionally, `JGOperationQueue` handles the status bar NetworkActivityIndicator, according to the number of enqueued operations and the background task used for networking requests when the app runs in the background.

	BOOL handleNetworkActivityIndicator
	BOOL handleBackgroundTask
  
Note that when setting `handleBackgroundTask` to `YES`, the App's Info.plist file needs to have "Application uses Wi-Fi" set to `YES`.

##Example
An example usage can be found in the Sample Project.

##Requirements
`JGDownloadAcceleration` is built for use with ARC and weak references. This means that iOS 5 or higher is required for using `JGDownloadAcceleration`

__*If your project doesn't use ARC*: you must add the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag to all JGDownloadAcceleration files in Target Settings > Build Phases > Compile Sources.__
